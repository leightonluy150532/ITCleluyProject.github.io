Hello, I am Leighton Enzo M. Luy

I am an information technology student at Ateneo de Davao University. 

Here is my project's first website, containing assignment projects such as a Conversion calculator, an Income tax calculator, and a Payroll System website.

Here, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as my first-year projects. 
 
Hope you enjoyed visiting my GitHub portfolio.
